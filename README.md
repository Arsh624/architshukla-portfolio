# Archit Shukla â€“ Developer Portfolio

## Overview

This is a single-page developer portfolio that showcases my dual-specialization: **Software Engineering** and **Machine Learning Engineering**. It offers a clean, immersive interface built with modern web technologies and creative UI/UX patterns.

The portfolio includes animated transitions, a dual-resume viewer, project popups with GitHub/demo links, and a smooth user experience across devices.
